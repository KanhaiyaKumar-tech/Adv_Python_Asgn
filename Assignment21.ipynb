True random numbers are generated from unpredictable physical processes, such as radioactive decay or atmospheric noise. They are inherently random and cannot be predicted or reproduced. On the other hand, pseudo-random numbers are generated using deterministic algorithms that produce a sequence of numbers that appear to be random but are actually determined by an initial seed value. While pseudo-random numbers are not truly random, they are considered \"good enough\" for many practical applications where randomness is needed, such as simulations or cryptography.\n"
