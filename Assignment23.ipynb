The benefit of compound interest over a higher rate of interest that does not compound is that it allows for exponential growth of the investment or loan. With compound interest, the interest earned in each period is added to the principal, leading to a larger base for calculating future interest. This compounding effect can result in significantly higher returns or larger loan balances over time compared to a simple interest calculation.\n"
