A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects, while an object is an instance of a class. Classes define attributes (data) and methods (functions) that objects can have and perform. Understanding how to define classes, create instances, and work with attributes and methods is essential.\n",

This promotes code reuse and enables the creation of specialized classes based on existing ones. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the use of a common interface to work with different objects interchangeably, providing flexibility and modularity in code design."
